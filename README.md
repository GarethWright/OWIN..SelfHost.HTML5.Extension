# OWIN.SelfHost.HTML5.Extension
Extension methods and helper for no conflict self hosting html5mode apps with routing
It took a lot of searching and trial and error to get a simple way of doing this, so posting my final working code to Github so you don't have to go through the pain I did!

` appBuilder.UseHTML5Server(Settings.Default.clientFolder, "/index.html");`

 `appBuilder.UseHTML5Server(@"c:\wwwDocs", "/index.html");`
